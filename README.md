### Sentence level annotations for the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge using biomedical ontologies from SciBite ###



## Overview ##
In March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, The White House, AI2, CZI, MSR, Georgetown and NIH released an open research dataset along with a call for action (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/) from the science and technology community. The call asks that artificial intelligence experts to develop new text and data mining techniques that can help the science community answer high-priority scientific questions related to COVID-19. The origina datasets can be accessed at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge

## What is in this SciBite annotated dataset? ##

Our ontology and SciBiteAI teams have used our software to produce sentence level annotations on this dataset to help those trying to identify biomedical entities within the text. The following have been identified




## Possible use examples of this annotated dataset ##

Identfying biomedical entities within sentences can be incredibly useful in narrowing down the curation space
